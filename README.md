This description is my thesis done at the end (2019) of my electrical engineering bachelor's degree at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
The integration of the module gives oppurtuntiy for 
simulating certain transients with the help of a less detailed model, than the one used 
before. It is in C#

Neutron point kinetics model is a neutron physical approach that is capable of describing
the neutron kinetics proccesses taken place in a reactor core. By supposing the 
separability of the neutron flux in time and space, we can derive an ordinary differential 
equation system. This approach was more used for neutron kinetics simulation back in 
the days when the computing capacity was more limited, but today there is opportunity 
for using resource demanding solutions that give a more detailed description. That is why 
in the full scope simulator of Paks NPP, there has been such a solution for neutron kinetics 
that gives a detailed solution: KIKO3D is based on solving diffusion equation and 
nodalizing.
